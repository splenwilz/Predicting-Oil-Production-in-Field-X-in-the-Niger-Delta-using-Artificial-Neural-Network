# Predicting-Oil-Production-in-Field-X-in-the-Niger-Delta-using-Artificial-Neural-Network

This repository contains all the information related to my final paper, "Oil Production Prediction in Field X in the Niger Delta using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)," which was completed at the Department of Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Uyo, Uyo. It includes a dataset utilized in the study that has 7850 rows of cleansed data from a prior study that employed multiple regression to address the same issue. I'll be evaluating the efficacy of several neural networks on the test dataset in this project. My analysis, debate, and conclusion will all be in the repository.
