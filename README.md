# Predicting-Oil-Production-in-Field-X-in-the-Niger-Delta-using-Artificial-Neural-Network

This repository contains all the information related to my final year project, "Oil Production Prediction in Field X in the Niger Delta using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)," written in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the award of Bachelor of Engineering in Petroleum Engineering. It includes a cleaned dataset from a previous study that employed multiple regression to address the same issue. I'll be evaluating the efficacy of several neural networks on the test dataset in this project. My analysis, debate, and conclusion will all be in this repository.
